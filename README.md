  ## Description
  This project is recreating my portfolio from earlier in the bootcamp - this time using React and Bootstrap. There are 4 pages - About Me, Portfolio, Contact and Resume. The About Me page gdisplays a small avatar of me plus a couple paragraphs describing my time as a developer. The Portfolio page lists 6 of my projects with their title, tech used, a link of the deployed application and a link to the GitHub repo. The Contact page has a form with Name, Email and Message fields. All 3 fields are required and the email address must be valid. The Resume page lists all of my competencies as well as a link to download a PDF version of my resume.
