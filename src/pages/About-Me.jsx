            <p>I have so much to learn.</p>
            <p>I am a Senior Software Engineer who wrote his first program at the age of 12 - it was a simple slot
                machine that was created as I read Teach Yourself C in 24 Hours. I had a lot of fun but I was not hooked
                - at least not yet. It was not until I started playing an online game, many years later, that was
                written in PHP that I was hooked. I was fascinated with how the inner workings of the game operated and
                I began to teach myself PHP. Eventually I joined the games staff volunteering my time to help fix
                defects, make small updates and further my knowledge of PHP and MySQL.</p>
            <p>After a number of years working in different positions at Billtrust, including as a QA Engineer, I
                transitioned into a Software Developer position. I was able to get up to speed relatively quickly as we
                were utilizing PHP and MySQL. I really enjoyed the work as it felt like I was actually making a
                difference, no matter how small, in our customers users day to day lives. I spent the majority of my
                time making fixes and adding new features.</p>
            <p>4 years later, I was moved to another team, working on a new product utilizing an updated tech stack.
                This product utilized .NET Core, MySQL, MongoDB and AWS. On this team, everything we worked on was new
                development and we had more freedom over how we built things. This work was also very enjoyable because
                of the challenge of learning a new tech while simultaneously building a new product. After a year
                working on this team I was promoted to Senior Software Developer and got involved with the design
                implementation of the reporting component of the product. This included designing and developing a REST
                API for the UI to pull the correct reports for the user to view.</p>
            <p>It has been multiple decades since I wrote that first slot machine program and I have learned a lot from
                then to now but one thing has never changed - I have so much to learn.</p>
